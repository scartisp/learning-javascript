//this will show what the object function1 is equal to, and it is equal to greeting
console.log(function1);
//this will return the type of function1, which is function
function1();
//this will cause an error: "greeting is not defined" because "greeting" is function1's internal name, and it exists only inside of greeting's own scope (this allows for recurssion)
//can delete greeting, and that makes it an anonymous function
//console.log(greeting());

//can also call greeting by calling function1()
function1();

//HOISTING
/*this is like the issue in C++, where it compiles top from bottom. 

function greeting() {
} 
this version has hoisting, meaning it is like Java in which order does not matter. You can reference the function before you define it

const function1 = function() {
}
this does not have hoisting, meaning you cannot use the function before you define it

//PASSING FUNCTIONS INTO FUNCTIONS

//ASYNCHRONOUS CODE: 

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log('timeout');
}, 3000) // setTimeOut if built in function that takes in two parameters: 
         // function it is supposed to execute, and how long it should wait before executing (in ms)

//the below line will execute before the timeout one. This is because setTimeout does not kill execusion for x miliseconds, but simply sets a timer (asynchronous).
console.log('this line will execute first');

setInterval(function() {
  console.log('interval');
},3000); // this function takes a function as the first argument, and executes it every x amount of time where x is in miliseconds. also asyncrhonous
